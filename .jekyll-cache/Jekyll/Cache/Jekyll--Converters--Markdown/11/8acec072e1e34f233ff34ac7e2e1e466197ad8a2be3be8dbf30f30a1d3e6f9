I"<p>Hi, my name is Steve and I am a Mechanical Engineer with expertise in wellbore surveying and mechanical data analysis. I specialize in supporting businesses to achieve their goals and meet customer requirements. I do this by applying engineering principles backed by data to affect operational decisions. I have been successful because of my ability to learn and leverage technology to create efficiency while building strong relationships with clients. I have worked in manufacturing facilities, in oilfields on drilling rigs in the arctic, and in client offices. I also ran a successful photography business, focused on seasonal family portraits and small events.</p>
