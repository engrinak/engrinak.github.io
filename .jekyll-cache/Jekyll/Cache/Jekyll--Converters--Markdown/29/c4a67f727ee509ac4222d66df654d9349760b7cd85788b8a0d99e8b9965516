I"ð<p>Hello, my name is Stephen Fell.  Thank you for visiting my page.  My background is in Mechanical Engineering (B.Eng, 2004).  I began my career working in manufacturing environments for a few years and then transitioned my career into the Oil &amp; Gas industry in 2007.  For five years, I worked as a field engineer in remote locations such as Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.  I then moved to an office based client facing position in Anchorage in 2012 as a drilling optimization engineer.  In this role, I performed a lot of data-wrangling and analysis and this is where I became more interested in Data Science.  In 2019, my career advanced further and I took on a role as a Drilling Engineer in another client office.  However, in April 2020 I became unemployed and am now taking some time to put together a collection of Python and Data Analysis examples mainly to serve as a reference in my job searches.</p>
